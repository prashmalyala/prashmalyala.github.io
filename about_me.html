        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>Hi there, my name is Prashant. I love to lead, read, write, take photos, travel, teach, spend quality time with my friends & family, and play basketball.</p>
        <p>If I had to distill my passion for life down into a couple of key principles, I think they would be:</p>
        <p>
          1. Witnessing, capturing, and expressing the beauty present in life. <br>
          2. Sharing that beauty with others.
        </p>
        <p>I enjoy working on projects and initiatives that have a clear, meaningful impact on others and love observing where visionary thinking meets brilliant execution.</p>
        <p>I'm currently an Associate Product Manager (APM) at Google, where I work on improving Gaming experiences in YouTube App Ads.</p>
