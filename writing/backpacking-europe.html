        <h1 style="text-align: center;">Backpacking Europe</h1>
        <p>Through June and July of Summer 2022, I plan to backpack / solo travel across Europe. Here, I'll 
            be keeping an updated record of my thoughts, feelings, and reflections during the journey.

        <h1>London, U.K.: 6/7-6/11</h1>

        <h2>Overall Experience</h2>
        <p>
          London was extraordinary. Many of the city's calling cards—its bustling nature and diversity, amazing public transport, international food options, inexhaustible list of things to do, and major parks & city centers—were very resemblant to me of New York City, one of my favorite cities in the world. Beyond that, London also seemed quite safe and had a good work-life balance culture (afternoon teas and trips to the pub were common), had a significant portion of its architecture decorated in the beautiful Gothic style, and had a strong presence in and bearing on international scholarship, history, and pop culture.
          <br></br>
          Although I absolutely loved London, it wasn't everything I had fully intended for with my trip. Despite the international scene being quite rich there, I did hope to see a place that felt like it had a bit more culture to it (e.g. unique style of cuisine, language, etc.) beyond inspiring my favorite Harry Potter novels. Additionally, at times, London also felt too good to be true—questioning how every building on every street had postcard-worthy architecture inevitably led you to how the U.K. managed to finance it all through imperialism. And knowing that very fact almost changed the way you walked around there, feeling as though you'd happened upon the plot of a dystopian novel amidst your wanderings.
          <br></br>
          Nonetheless, today, London is a massive cultural mixing pot, with some of the people I met in the hostels originating anywhere from Norway or France to Tunisia or Japan (and actually a lot of people from Canada). Such diversity coupled with access to the rest of Europe and the many things I loved about London as a metropolitan city make me very keen to visit again, and perhaps one day even live there.
